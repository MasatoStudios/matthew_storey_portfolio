				Working on this project was the most freedom Iâ€™ve had in a project so
				far i was the lead developer, designer and manager whilst being the
				client at the same time. My vision for this was to create a minimalistic
				site which showcases all my skills. The whole site uses ES6 standards
				such as arrow functions and hooks with props. Overall I am really happy
				with the final piece. However in the future I do plan to add a
				playgrounds tab where I can add all experimental features I create.
