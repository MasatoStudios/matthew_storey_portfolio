					Working on this project was the most freedom Iâ€™ve had in a project so
					far. I was the lead developer, designer and manager whilst being the
					client at the same time. My vision for this was to create a
					minimalistic site which showcases all my skills. The whole site uses
					ES6 standards such as arrow functions and hooks with props. Overall I
					am really happy with the final piece. However, in the future I do plan
					to add a playgrounds tab where I can add all experimental features I create.
